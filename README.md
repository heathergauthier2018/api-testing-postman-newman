# 🍸 API Testing Suite – TheCocktailDB (Postman + Newman)

This project is an automated API testing suite for [TheCocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/), built with **Postman** and executed via **Newman**.  

It is designed both as a **professional portfolio piece** and as a **practical regression suite** for any app that consumes TheCocktailDB (for example, my Cocktail Finder UI project).

---

## ✨ What this project demonstrates

- Designing a **structured Postman collection** for a real public API
- Writing **automated tests** in Postman:
  - Happy-path functional tests
  - Negative / edge-case tests
  - Basic performance checks (response time)
- Using **collection variables** and query parameters
- Running the entire suite from the **command line with Newman**
- Generating an **HTML report** using `newman-reporter-htmlextra`
- Organizing the project so it’s easy to plug into CI (GitHub Actions, etc.)

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Postman** – request definitions & test scripts  
- **Newman** – CLI runner for Postman collections  
- **newman-reporter-htmlextra** – HTML test report dashboard  
- **Node.js + npm** – dependency and script management  
- **JavaScript / ChaiJS** – assertion layer inside Postman tests

🌐 API Under Test

All requests target the base URL:

https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1


This is stored as a Postman collection variable:

baseUrl = https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1

🧪 Endpoints & Scenarios Covered
1. Search Cocktails by Name

GET /search.php?s=margarita

Tests:

Status code is 200

Response time < 800 ms

Response is JSON

drinks exists and is a non-empty array

2. Get Cocktail by ID

GET /lookup.php?i=11007

Tests:

Status code is 200

Response is JSON

drinks exists and is a non-empty array

First drink has idDrink = "11007"

3. Search with Invalid Cocktail Name (Negative)

GET /search.php?s=sdjasdjhasdjk

Tests:

Status code is 200 (API returns 200 even for “no results”)

drinks is null or an empty array

4. Filter Cocktails by Category

GET /filter.php?c=Cocktail

Tests:

Status code is 200

Response time < 800 ms

Response is JSON

drinks array is not empty

Each drink has idDrink, strDrink, strDrinkThumb

5. Filter Cocktails by Ingredient (Vodka)

GET /filter.php?i=Vodka

Tests:

Status code is 200

Response time < 800 ms

Response is JSON

drinks array is not empty

Each drink has idDrink, strDrink, strDrinkThumb

6. Get Random Cocktail

GET /random.php

Tests:

Status code is 200

Response time < 800 ms

Response is JSON

drinks array exists

Each drink has idDrink, strDrink, strDrinkThumb

7. Get Cocktail by Invalid ID (Negative)

GET /lookup.php?i=9999999

Tests:

Status code is 200

drinks is null or an empty array

8. Search with Empty Name (Edge Case)

GET /search.php?s=

Tests:

Status code is 200

drinks equals "no data found" (API’s special-case behavior)

9. Search with Uppercase Name (Case-Insensitive Search)

GET /search.php?s=MARGARITA

Tests:

Status code is 200

drinks array is not empty

At least one drink name contains “margarita” (case-insensitive)

10. Search with Space in Name (URL Encoding)

GET /search.php?s=Bloody%20Mary

Tests:

Status code is 200

drinks array is not empty

At least one drink contains “Bloody Mary” in its name (case-insensitive)

Total: 10 requests, 34 assertions – all passing under Newman ✅

▶️ Running the Suite with Newman
1. Install dependencies
npm install

2. Run the tests
npm run test:api


This runs:

newman run postman/collections/cocktail-api-testing-collection.json \
  -r cli,htmlextra \
  --reporter-htmlextra-export reports/cocktail-api-report.html

📊 HTML Report

After a run, Newman generates:

reports/cocktail-api-report.html


Open this file in your browser to see:

Overall summary (iterations, requests, assertions)

Per-request breakdown

Response times and sizes

Pass/fail for each assertion

This report is what you’ll see in the “Newman Run Dashboard” screenshots.

🧩 Future Enhancements

Add environment files for different base URLs (mock vs. live)

Integrate the suite with GitHub Actions to run on every push

Add schema validation and more data-driven tests

Extend coverage to additional TheCocktailDB endpoints
